                Tattoo Aftercare: What You Need to Know
            </h1>
            <h3>
                A tattoo is more than just a piece of art and a way to assert your personal style. It’s a medical
                procedure, because the artist uses a needle to insert the ink underneath your skin. Any time you open
                the skin you leave yourself vulnerable to scarring and infections.

                Caring for your tattoo can prevent these complications and ensure that it heals properly. Both you and
                your artist play equal roles in this process. Along with going to a licensed and reputable tattoo
                artist you need to take care of your new tattoo at home.

            <h2 class=" p-3">How to care for your tattoo</h2>
            <p>
                Aftercare starts as soon as your tattoo is done. The artist should apply a thin layer of petroleum
                ointment over the tattoo, and then cover the area in a bandage or plastic wrap. This covering prevents
                bacteria from getting into your skin. It also protects the tattoo from rubbing on your clothes and
                getting irritated.

                Keep the dressing on for a few hours. It will help absorb any fluid or excess ink that leaks from the
                tattoo.

                After a few hours, you can remove the bandage. Wash your hands first with lukewarm water and soap. Then
                gently wash the tattoo with fragrance-free soap and water.

                Pat your skin dry with a soft cloth. Apply a small amount of petroleum ointment to the tattoo. You can
                keep the bandage off at this point to let your skin breathe.
            </p>

            <div class="art-image py-3">
                <img src="/img/about4.png" alt="Pain" />
            </div>
            <p>
                While your tattoo heals, you should:
                <ul>
                    <li>wear sun-protective clothing whenever you go outside</li>
                    <li>call your tattoo artist or doctor if you have any signs of infection or other problems</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                You shouldn’t:
                <ul>
                    <li>cover your tattoo with sunblock until it’s fully healed</li>
                    <li>scratch or pick at the tattoo</li>
                    <li>wear tight clothing over the tattoo</li>
                    <li>go swimming or immerse your body in water (showers are fine)</li>

        <div class="main-section">
            <h2 class="p-3">The design</h2>
            <p>
                Don’t rush when picking a tattoo design. Just don’t. You
                might regret it as soon as the tattoo artist inserts the
                last drop of ink. You need to spend lots of time researching
                the design. You can check out all sorts of tattoos on Google
                to come up with ideas. You can even get a tattoo artist to
                help you with the design. Actually, the latter is
                recommended, especially if you want a really personal
                design. People often go for meaningful tattoo designs. Like
                Bible verses, names of loved ones, personal mantras, and
                symbols that represent their lives. But you don’t
                necessarily have to go the meaningful route.
            </p>

            <div class="art-image py-3">
                <img src="/img/about2.jpg" alt="" />
            </div>
            <p>
                The important thing is to go with a tattoo design that you
                won’t regret and won’t be ashamed of having. In short,
                something you can be proud of. Even if it’s just a copied
                design. Let’s face it, there are really good designs already
                existing on other people’s skins out there, easily viewable
                via Google. So if you find an already tattooed design that
                you really want, go for it. If you want, you can ask the
                artist to make a few customizations to make it slightly
                different. Still, when possible, go for an original and more
                personal design. It doesn’t have to make sense to other
                people. As long as it makes sense to you, then roll with it.
                Again, don’t be afraid to ask artists for their opinion when
                it comes to the design. They will be more than happy to give
                input.
            </p>

        <div class="main-section py-2">
            <h2 class="p-3">Day 1</h2>
            <p>
                You’ll come home from the artist with a bandage over your tattoo. After a few hours, you can remove it.
                You should ask your artist for specifics about how long to wait.
                Once the bandage comes off, you’ll probably notice fluid oozing from the tattoo. This is blood, plasma
                (the clear part of blood), and some extra ink. It’s normal. Your skin will also be red and sore. It
                might feel slightly warm to the touch.
                With clean hands, wash the tattoo with warm water and a fragrance-free soap. Apply a petroleum ointment.
                Leave the bandage off so the tattoo can heal.
            </p>

            <div class="art-image py-3">
                <img src="/img/about5.jpg" alt="" />
            </div>

            <p>
                Another thing to think about is whether having lots of
                visible tattoos will hurt your chances of getting a job in
                the future. For example, if you want to be a real estate
                salesperson or any job that requires face-to-face
                interactions with clients, don’t even think about getting
                tattooed on the face. Some employers are conservative when
                it comes to tattoos. Don’t blame tattoo discrimination if
                you didn’t get that frontline job at Burger King because
                your face is covered with ink. Most importantly, different
                locations produce different levels of pain. In general,
                getting tattooed in an area with lots of muscle or fat will
                hurt less than getting inked where there are lots of bones.
                For first-timers, we definitely don’t recommend getting a
                tattoo on the ribs. It is considered one of the most painful
                experiences ever. Please trust us on this one.

        <div class="main-section py-2">
            <h2 class="p-3">Reason for getting one</h2>
            <p>
                There are many possible reasons why people get under the
                needle and get inked. Some get tattooed because they
                appreciate it as a form of art. Some get tattooed as a show
                of love or infatuation. Some get tattooed to openly show
                rebellion. And some simply get tattooed because they think
                it’s really cool. Before getting a tattoo, consider why you
                want one. You don’t necessarily need to come up with an
                overly sentimental or profound reason to get a tattoo. Just
                make sure that whatever reason you come up with, you will be
                able to stand by it.
            </p>

            <div class="art-image py-3">
                <img src="/img/about3.jpg" alt="" />
            </div>
            <p>
                And, definitely, don’t allow other people to make the
                decision for you. Other people can inspire you to get inked.
                But the final decision still rests in your hands. Getting a
                tattoo is a permanent investment. Going 180 when the tattoo
                is already set in place will be costly. And by “costly,” we
                mean paying more money for tattoo laser removal. If there is
                even the slightest hint of hesitation inside you, don’t go
                for it. Mull it over again and make the ultimate decision
                after another round or two of thinking.

        <div class="main-section py-2">
            <h2 class="p-3">Timing is everything</h2>
            <p>
                You can walk into a tattoo shop and get inked anytime you
                want. No one is going to stop you from doing that. But there
                are optimal times to get a tattoo. The best time to get a
                tattoo is during Fall or Winter when people typically have
                more clothes when outside. This shields a newly inked tattoo
                from the sun, which is the sworn enemy of a new tattoo. Too
                much exposure to direct sunlight will harm a fresh tattoo.
                Not only will it cause irritation, it could cause early
                fading as well. People tend to get tattoos during summertime
                in order to show it off to anyone within a 10-mile radius.
                This is perhaps the most common mistake first-timers commit.
                We understand that people want to flaunt a gorgeous-looking
                tattoo.
            </p>

            <div class="art-image py-3">
                <img src="/img/about6.jpg" alt="" />
            </div>

            <p>
                But doing it while the wound is still fresh will do more
                harm than good. If you want to show off a new tattoo in time
                for summer, get it during Fall or Winter. It will be fully
                healed by then. But make sure to still apply a healthy
                amount of protective lotion on the tattoo. Even when a
                tattoo is fully healed, too much direct sunlight can still
                speed up the fading process, which leads to early touch-ups.
                Also, keep in mind that it is not recommended to go on
                swimming trips while a tattoo is still fresh. Okay, maybe
                you can go with friends. But definitely, don’t join in the
                water festivities. Just sit back away from the water and
                think about why you got a tattoo one week before a swimming
                trip.

        <div class="main-section py-2">
            <h2 class="p-3">Skin allergies</h2>
            <p>
                If you have a known skin allergy, no matter how minor it is,
                make sure to consult a doctor first whether getting a tattoo
                would be a good idea. You will never truly know how your
                skin will react to being drilled with multiple needles and
                having chemicals inserted into it until the ordeal is done.
                If the doctor says no but you still want to go ahead with
                the tattoo, be prepared to take full responsibility should
                everything go wrong. There are different kinds of allergic
                reactions to tattoos. Some produce only minor and manageable
                itchiness or skin irritation. Some result in rashes or
                swelling.
            </p>
            <div class="art-image py-3">
                <img src="/img/about7.jpeg" alt="" />
            </div>
            <p>
                It can also result in small lumps forming around the
                tattooed area. Even if you don’t have a history of skin
                allergies or allergies in general, it would be wise to pay
                close attention to how your body reacts while getting
                tattooed. Call for a timeout as soon as you feel something
                unusual. And, if necessary, don’t hesitate to abort the
                mission.
