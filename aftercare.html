                    Tattoo Aftercare: What You Need to Know

                <h3>
                    A tattoo is more than just a piece of art and a way to
                    assert your personal style. It’s a medical procedure,
                    because the artist uses a needle to insert the ink
                    underneath your skin. Any time you open the skin you leave
                    yourself vulnerable to scarring and infections. Caring for
                    your tattoo can prevent these complications and ensure that
                    it heals properly. Both you and your artist play equal roles
                    in this process. Along with going to a licensed and
                    reputable tattoo artist you need to take care of your new
                    tattoo at home.

                <p>
                    Aftercare starts as soon as your tattoo is done. The artist
                    should apply a thin layer of petroleum ointment over the
                    tattoo, and then cover the area in a bandage or plastic
                    wrap. This covering prevents bacteria from getting into your
                    skin. It also protects the tattoo from rubbing on your
                    clothes and getting irritated. Keep the dressing on for a
                    few hours. It will help absorb any fluid or excess ink that
                    leaks from the tattoo. After a few hours, you can remove the
                    bandage. Wash your hands first with lukewarm water and soap.
                    Then gently wash the tattoo with fragrance-free soap and
                    water. Pat your skin dry with a soft cloth. Apply a small
                    amount of petroleum ointment to the tattoo. You can keep the
                    bandage off at this point to let your skin breathe.

                    <br />
                    - wear sun-protective clothing whenever you go outside

                    - call your tattoo artist or doctor if you have any signs of
                    infection or other problems.

                    <u>You shouldn’t:</u>
                    <br />
                    -cover your tattoo with sunblock until it’s fully healed
                    <br />
                    -scratch or pick at the tattoo -wear tight clothing over the

                    - go swimming or immerse your body in water (showers are

                <p>
                    You’ll come home from the artist with a bandage over your
                    tattoo. After a few hours, you can remove it. You should ask
                    your artist for specifics about how long to wait. Once the
                    bandage comes off, you’ll probably notice fluid oozing from
                    the tattoo. This is blood, plasma (the clear part of blood),
                    and some extra ink. It’s normal. Your skin will also be red
                    and sore. It might feel slightly warm to the touch. With
                    clean hands, wash the tattoo with warm water and a
                    fragrance-free soap. Apply a petroleum ointment. Leave the
                    bandage off so the tattoo can heal.

                    <img
                        src="/img/aftercare/after2.jpg"
                        alt="Tattoo bandage"

                <p>
                    Another thing to think about is whether having lots of
                    visible tattoos will hurt your chances of getting a job in
                    the future. For example, if you want to be a real estate
                    salesperson or any job that requires face-to-face
                    interactions with clients, don’t even think about getting
                    tattooed on the face. Some employers are conservative when
                    it comes to tattoos. Don’t blame tattoo discrimination if
                    you didn’t get that frontline job at Burger King because
                    your face is covered with ink. Most importantly, different
                    locations produce different levels of pain. In general,
                    getting tattooed in an area with lots of muscle or fat will
                    hurt less than getting inked where there are lots of bones.
                    For first-timers, we definitely don’t recommend getting a
                    tattoo on the ribs. It is considered one of the most painful
                    experiences ever. Please trust us on this one.
