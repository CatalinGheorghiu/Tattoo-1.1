                    Important Things to Consider Before Getting a Tattoo
                </h1>
                <h3>
                    Thinking about getting a tattoo? There are several things
                    that you need to carefully consider first before getting
                    inked. To help you make the right decision and potentially
                    save you from unnecessary pain, we came up with this
                    article. Here are 10 important things that you have to
                    consider before getting tattooed.
                </h3>
                <div class="art-image py-3">
                    <img src="/img/about1.jpg" alt="Tattoo Art" />

            <div class="main-section py-2">
                <h2 class=" p-3">Pain, pain, pain</h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a tattoo WILL hurt. Anyone who tells you otherwise
                    is either lying or only has a one-inch tattoo on the wrist.
                    The process involves multiple needles puncturing your skin
                    in order to insert ink. We don’t know about you, but none of
                    that sounds particularly pain-free. The bigger the tattoo
                    and the more elaborate the design, the more pain
                    experienced.
                </p>

                <div class="art-image py-3">
                    <img src="/img/about4.png" alt="Pain" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    The location of the tattoo is also a big factor when it
                    comes to the pain level . Again, getting a tattoo will hurt.
                    There will also be blood, obviously. So if you have an
                    aversion to needles or blood or generally have a low pain
                    threshold, we suggest thinking extra-hard about getting a
                    tattoo.
                </p>
            </div>

            <hr />

            <div class="main-section">
                <h2 class="p-3">The design</h2>
                <p>
                    Don’t rush when picking a tattoo design. Just don’t. You
                    might regret it as soon as the tattoo artist inserts the
                    last drop of ink. You need to spend lots of time researching
                    the design. You can check out all sorts of tattoos on Google
                    to come up with ideas. You can even get a tattoo artist to
                    help you with the design. Actually, the latter is
                    recommended, especially if you want a really personal
                    design. People often go for meaningful tattoo designs. Like
                    Bible verses, names of loved ones, personal mantras, and
                    symbols that represent their lives. But you don’t
                    necessarily have to go the meaningful route.
                </p>

                <div class="art-image py-3">
                    <img src="/img/about2.jpg" alt="" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    The important thing is to go with a tattoo design that you
                    won’t regret and won’t be ashamed of having. In short,
                    something you can be proud of. Even if it’s just a copied
                    design. Let’s face it, there are really good designs already
                    existing on other people’s skins out there, easily viewable
                    via Google. So if you find an already tattooed design that
                    you really want, go for it. If you want, you can ask the
                    artist to make a few customizations to make it slightly
                    different. Still, when possible, go for an original and more
                    personal design. It doesn’t have to make sense to other
                    people. As long as it makes sense to you, then roll with it.
                    Again, don’t be afraid to ask artists for their opinion when
                    it comes to the design. They will be more than happy to give
                    input.
                </p>
            </div>

            <hr />

            <div class="main-section py-2">
                <h2 class="p-3">Tattoo placement</h2>
                <p>
                    Deciding where you want the tattoo goes hand-in-hand with
                    picking the design. There are certain designs that are best
                    suited for specific body parts. The size of the design also
                    factors into the location of the tattoo. For example, a
                    landscape that shows a breathtaking view of Mount Fuji works
                    best on the upper back, while a portrait of someone looks
                    great either on the chest (for men) or on the triceps. If
                    you want your tattoo to be a private thing and don’t want
                    other relatives pestering you with pointed questions during
                    family reunions, you might want to get tattooed in areas
                    normally covered in clothes. On the other hand, if you want
                    everyone to marvel at your colorful tattoos, feel free to
                    have them on usually uncovered areas like forearms and
                    hands.
                </p>

                <div class="art-image py-3">
                    <img src="/img/about5.jpg" alt="" />
                </div>

                <p>
                    Another thing to think about is whether having lots of
                    visible tattoos will hurt your chances of getting a job in
                    the future. For example, if you want to be a real estate
                    salesperson or any job that requires face-to-face
                    interactions with clients, don’t even think about getting
                    tattooed on the face. Some employers are conservative when
                    it comes to tattoos. Don’t blame tattoo discrimination if
                    you didn’t get that frontline job at Burger King because
                    your face is covered with ink. Most importantly, different
                    locations produce different levels of pain. In general,
                    getting tattooed in an area with lots of muscle or fat will
                    hurt less than getting inked where there are lots of bones.
                    For first-timers, we definitely don’t recommend getting a
                    tattoo on the ribs. It is considered one of the most painful
                    experiences ever. Please trust us on this one.

            <div class="main-section py-2">
                <h2 class="p-3">Reason for getting one</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many possible reasons why people get under the
                    needle and get inked. Some get tattooed because they
                    appreciate it as a form of art. Some get tattooed as a show
                    of love or infatuation. Some get tattooed to openly show
                    rebellion. And some simply get tattooed because they think
                    it’s really cool. Before getting a tattoo, consider why you
                    want one. You don’t necessarily need to come up with an
                    overly sentimental or profound reason to get a tattoo. Just
                    make sure that whatever reason you come up with, you will be
                    able to stand by it.
                </p>

                <div class="art-image py-3">
                    <img src="/img/about3.jpg" alt="" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    And, definitely, don’t allow other people to make the
                    decision for you. Other people can inspire you to get inked.
                    But the final decision still rests in your hands. Getting a
                    tattoo is a permanent investment. Going 180 when the tattoo
                    is already set in place will be costly. And by “costly,” we
                    mean paying more money for tattoo laser removal. If there is
                    even the slightest hint of hesitation inside you, don’t go
                    for it. Mull it over again and make the ultimate decision
                    after another round or two of thinking.
                </p>

            <div class="main-section py-2">
                <h2 class="p-3">Timing is everything</h2>
                <p>
                    You can walk into a tattoo shop and get inked anytime you
                    want. No one is going to stop you from doing that. But there
                    are optimal times to get a tattoo. The best time to get a
                    tattoo is during Fall or Winter when people typically have
                    more clothes when outside. This shields a newly inked tattoo
                    from the sun, which is the sworn enemy of a new tattoo. Too
                    much exposure to direct sunlight will harm a fresh tattoo.
                    Not only will it cause irritation, it could cause early
                    fading as well. People tend to get tattoos during summertime
                    in order to show it off to anyone within a 10-mile radius.
                    This is perhaps the most common mistake first-timers commit.
                    We understand that people want to flaunt a gorgeous-looking
                    tattoo.
                </p>

                <div class="art-image py-3">
                    <img src="/img/about6.jpg" alt="" />
                </div>

                <p>
                    But doing it while the wound is still fresh will do more
                    harm than good. If you want to show off a new tattoo in time
                    for summer, get it during Fall or Winter. It will be fully
                    healed by then. But make sure to still apply a healthy
                    amount of protective lotion on the tattoo. Even when a
                    tattoo is fully healed, too much direct sunlight can still
                    speed up the fading process, which leads to early touch-ups.
                    Also, keep in mind that it is not recommended to go on
                    swimming trips while a tattoo is still fresh. Okay, maybe
                    you can go with friends. But definitely, don’t join in the
                    water festivities. Just sit back away from the water and
                    think about why you got a tattoo one week before a swimming
                    trip.

            <div class="main-section py-2">
                <h2 class="p-3">Skin allergies</h2>
                <p>
                    If you have a known skin allergy, no matter how minor it is,
                    make sure to consult a doctor first whether getting a tattoo
                    would be a good idea. You will never truly know how your
                    skin will react to being drilled with multiple needles and
                    having chemicals inserted into it until the ordeal is done.
                    If the doctor says no but you still want to go ahead with
                    the tattoo, be prepared to take full responsibility should
                    everything go wrong. There are different kinds of allergic
                    reactions to tattoos. Some produce only minor and manageable
                    itchiness or skin irritation. Some result in rashes or
                    swelling.
                </p>
                <div class="art-image py-3">
                    <img src="/img/about7.jpeg" alt="" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    It can also result in small lumps forming around the
                    tattooed area. Even if you don’t have a history of skin
                    allergies or allergies in general, it would be wise to pay
                    close attention to how your body reacts while getting
                    tattooed. Call for a timeout as soon as you feel something
                    unusual. And, if necessary, don’t hesitate to abort the
                    mission.
